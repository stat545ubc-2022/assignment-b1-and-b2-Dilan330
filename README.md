# STAT 545B: Assignment B1 and B2 
 
Welcome to Dilan's STAT545 ASB1 and ASB2 Repository. Here you will find files associated with either ASB1 or ASB2, which will be marked by the file name. In ASB1 we used packages like `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, and `testthat` to create a simple function which calculates the difference between the average adult height (per sex) and an inputted height. Please post an issue under the *issues* tab for any questions, comments or concerns regarding the repository. 
In ASB2 we are wrapped the function created in ASB2 into an R package using the `devtools` package.
