<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ASB2 is to provide information regarding the average adult height (per sex) and compare it to inputted heights. This package contains a function which displays the average adult height (for the selected sex) and calculates the absolute difference between it and an inputted height (in cm)

## Installation

You can install the development version of ASB2 like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Dilan330/ASB2, ref="0.1.0")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ASB2)

## Finding the absolute difference between the Canadian average height for a male and an inputted height (160 cm)
Avg_height_diff(160, male = TRUE)
```
